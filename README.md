# GPTBOOK

This project utilizes a chain of GPT-3 and Stable Diffusion API calls to generate an original fantasy novel. Users can provide an initial prompt and enter how many chapters they'd like it to be, and the AI then generates an entire novel, outputting an EPUB(Electronic Publication) file compatible with e-book readers.
